How to setup:
    1. Create venv
    Execute:
    "C:\Users\krum2\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe" -m venv venv
    in order to create venv.

    Do not use "C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\python.exe" because it doesn't work good with venv, pip and others.
    MinGW Python is compiled with GCC.

    2. Activate the venv:
    Execute 'venv\Scripts\activate' in the project root source.

    3. Install requirements:
    Execute 'pip install -r requirements.txt'  in the project root source.
